NAME
    String::ToIdentifier::EN - Convert Strings to English Program
    Identifiers

SYNOPSIS
        use String::ToIdentifier::EN 'to_identifier';

        to_identifier 'foo-bar';      # FooDashBar
        to_identifier 'foo-bar', '_'; # foo_dash_bar
        to_identifier 'foo.bar', '_'; # foo_dot_bar

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a utility method, "to_identifier" for converting an
    arbitrary string into a readable representation using the ASCII subset
    of "\w" for use as an identifier in a computer program. The intent is to
    make unique identifier names from which the content of the original
    string can be easily inferred by a human just by reading the identifier.

    Currently, this process is one way only, and will likely remain this
    way.

    The default is to create CamelCase identifiers, or you may pass in a
    separator char of your choice such as "_".

EXPORT
    Optionally exports the "to_identifier" function.

SUBROUTINES
  to_identifier
    Takes the string to be converted to an identifier, and optionally a
    separator char such as "_". If a separator char is not provided, a
    CamelCase identifier will be returned.
